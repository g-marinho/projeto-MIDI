## Overview

I'm at the beginning of my journey with web development. This is my third project using JavaScript. I used it to train programming logic, using simple decision structures and loops, a bit how to capture keyboard events. I needed to use the p5.js library because I was having trouble understanding how to draw with JavaScript. I hope you enjoy this game.
